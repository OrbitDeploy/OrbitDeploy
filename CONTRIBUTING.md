### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed enhancement
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful
- List any similar features in other projects if applicable

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. Make your changes following our coding guidelines
3. Add tests for your changes if applicable
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Podman
- Git

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OrbitDeploy.git
cd OrbitDeploy

# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests
go test ./...
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (using bun)
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# From the root directory
go run main.go
```

The backend will start on port `:8285` by default.

## Coding Guidelines

### Go Code

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Write unit tests for new functionality

### TypeScript/JavaScript Code

- Follow the existing code style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Use ESLint for code linting
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Project Structure

- Backend code follows a modular structure with clear separation between HTTP layer, business logic (services), and data models
- Database models and API models are separated
- Frontend uses the API hooks from `frontend/src/api/apiHooksW.ts` (`useApiQuery`, `useApiMutation`)
- API endpoints are imported from `frontend/src/api/endpoints`

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and meaningful commit messages
- Start with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a detailed description if necessary

Example:
```
Add user authentication middleware

- Implement JWT token validation
- Add authentication required decorator
- Update documentation
```
